    <p class="color-example">Color (American English) or colour (British and Commonwealth English) is the visual
        perception
        based on the electromagnetic spectrum. Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is
        related to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra, and interference.</p>
    <h1 class="header-example">Rainbow Colors</h1>
    <ul class="list-example">
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Light Blue</li>
        <li>Dark Blue</li>
        <li>Violet</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-example">A rainbow is an optical phenomenon caused by refraction, internal reflection and dispersion
        of
        light in water droplets resulting in a continuous spectrum of light appearing in the sky. The rainbow takes the
        form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly
        opposite the Sun. Rainbows can be caused by many forms of airborne water. These include not only rain, but also
        mist, spray, and airborne dew.</p>

        The secret hiding spot for a leprechaun's pot of gold is often believed to be tucked away at the end of the
        rainbow.
