        <p>Generation Z (often shortened to Gen Z), also known as Zoomers, is the demographic cohort succeeding
            Millennials and preceding Generation Alpha. Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as
            starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years, with the generation most frequently being
            defined as people born from 1997 to 2012. Most members of Generation Z are the children of younger baby
            boomers or Generation X.</p>
